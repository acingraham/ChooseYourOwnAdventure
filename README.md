# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Project Description 
In this unit, coders will create a Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Students will create and modify objects that make up the levels of their game. 

### Planning
- [ ] Using pen and paper, create your own flow diagram for your own adventure game

### Set-up
- [ ] If you haven’t already, fork and clone the starter code here and create a new Cloud9 project

### Tasks
Modify the game.js file in the js folder to match the flow diagram you created
- [ ] Project has a “start” level object for the beginning of the game.
- [ ] Project has at least 4 new level objects not taken from the starter code. 
- [ ] Project includes at least 2 levels with at least 2 possible next_level choices.
- [ ] The final level(s) leads back to the “start” page to allow users to play again.
- [ ] Check to make sure your game works regularly as you make changes!

### Extensions
Only once you’ve got your game working
- [ ] Add a new background image or new background music to your game.
- [ ] Change the background image or music in a specific level.
