# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Planning
- [ ] Using pen and paper, create your own flow diagram for your own adventure game

## Set-up
- [ ] If you haven’t already, fork and clone the starter code here and create a new Cloud9 project

## Tasks
- [ ] Modify the game.js file in the js folder to match the flow diagram you created (must have at least 3 levels)
- [ ] Only once you’ve got your game working should you change the music or background images.
- [ ] Check to make sure your game works regularly as you make changes!


## Wrap
- [ ] Once finished, add your project to your portfolio!
